# Deploy to Vercel - Step by Step Guide

Your app is now ready for Vercel deployment! Follow these simple steps:

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- A Vercel account (free) at https://vercel.com

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository (name it anything you like, e.g., "naija-wealth-sim")
3. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
4. Copy the commands shown and run them in your Replit Shell

OR if you prefer, use Replit's GitHub integration:
1. Click the version control icon in Replit
2. Connect to GitHub
3. Create and push to a new repository

### Step 2: Deploy on Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up or log in (use your GitHub account)
3. Click "Add New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Vercel will automatically detect the configuration from `vercel.json`
6. Click "Deploy"

**That's it!** Your app will be live in 1-2 minutes.

## What Happens During Deployment

Vercel will:
- Install all dependencies
- Run `vite build` to create optimized production files
- Serve your app as a static site
- Give you a free `.vercel.app` domain
- Auto-deploy on every GitHub push

## Features That Work
âœ… All game functionality (investments, purchases, timers)
âœ… Tutorial system
âœ… Sound effects and music
âœ… Game over and continue system
âœ… Data persistence (localStorage)
âœ… Mobile-responsive design

## Important Notes
- The app runs entirely in the browser (no backend needed)
- All game data is stored in the player's browser (localStorage)
- Free Vercel tier is perfect for this app
- Auto-deploys when you push to GitHub

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails?**
- Make sure `vercel.json` is in the root directory
- Check that all files are committed to GitHub

**App doesn't load routes?**
- The `vercel.json` rewrite rules handle SPA routing automatically

**Need custom domain?**
- In Vercel dashboard, go to Project Settings â†’ Domains
- Add your custom domain (free on Vercel)

## Your Live URL
After deployment, you'll get a URL like:
`https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

Share it with anyone - it's live and ready to use! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
